# Alerts to help with life management.

## Philosophy

Tries to help with the problem of what, of the many things you could do with your time, should you do today.  The philosophy is that it's easier to focus if there is a limited number of things to focus on, so the app will help by selecting a specific number of things to remind you about, but with the understanding that if the app says you must do something, you must do it!


You can think of the app, depending upon your perspective, as one of:
- A nagging wife or husband
- A Mistress or Master
- Your boss
- A friend who has your best interests at heart

The app will assume a persona based on the above and the tone of messages will be designed to fit with whatever you think will work best for you.  You could even let someone else add the items and you will just see the alerts.

## What Will It Do?

The way the app will work is that you will tell the app things that you need to do, against a given category, such as work, home finances, your career etc., and provide certain information to the app such as the relative priority for the item, whether there is a drop dead date it must be done by etc., and the app will then alert you every day about one or more of the items on your list.  But it will limmit the number of things it alerts you about, so that there aren't too many things to get done in the day and you can't use the excuse that you didn't have time.

The app will try to use some algorithms to best select what to alert you about, based on information you provide.  Some examples of the rules might be:

- Some of your items may be more important than others, but you still want the non-important things done, so the app will mix lower and higher priority items.
- If a drop dead date is specified, the app will alert you with plenty of time to finish the item.  Note that drop dead date should only be used when there is a genuine immoveable date, beyond which if you fail to complete the item, there is a clear consequence.  This may apply to bills, tax returns etc, but in general won't apply to most items on the to do list because it's not as black and white as that.
- Items which have been on the list a long time will tend to be considered more important as the idea is to ensure things go onto and off the list.

Although you could theoretically use the app for your work to-do list, in general that may not be ideal as generally there are many things on a work to-do list and the idea of the app is to work through a list of items slowly but surely and at the time of writing it's not clear whether that would work for a very dynamic work environment.
